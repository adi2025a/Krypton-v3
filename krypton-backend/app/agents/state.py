"""
Shared state passed through every node in the LangGraph agent graph.

Think of this as a whiteboard: each node reads what it needs off it and
writes back only the field(s) it's responsible for. LangGraph merges
each node's partial return into this overall state automatically -- a
node returning {"indicators": {...}} does NOT wipe out `news_items` or
anything else already on the board.

Fields start as None and get filled in as the graph executes. By the
time `synthesis_node` runs, it reads whichever fields are populated
(risk_profile may legitimately still be None if Binance isn't connected)
and builds the final answer from whatever's actually available.
